# HEALTHCARE KPI’s & OUTCOMES REPORT 
## Project Overview
A Power BI report built for a healthcare system to deliver a data driven view of financial performance, clinical operations, patient demographics and revenue trends. Designed for Executive Insights, Operational Triage, and Clinical Program Management, the solution helps leaders act quickly on revenue shifts, capacity constraints, and high risk patient cohorts.
## Key Features
-	Executive KPI bar with Total Revenue, Average Billing per Patient, Total Patients, Refunds, and Average Length of Stay for an at a glance health of the business. 
-	 Filter Panel with Slicers for Date Range, Medical Condition, Admission Type, Insurance Provider, Age Group, length of stay and Test Result to drive cross filtering across all visuals.
-	Revenue Views: Total Revenue by Test Result, Medical Condition, Admission Type, and Insurance Provider to reveal payer and service mix. 
-	Clinical Operations: Admissions vs Discharges, LOS Range table, and Admission Type breakdown to monitor throughput and bed utilization. 
-	Patient Demographics: Age Group and Gender distributions, and Condition by Age Group to support targeted care programs. 
-	Trend Analysis: Revenue by Year and Revenue by Month to surface seasonality, growth, and recent declines. 
## Tech Stack
-	Power BI for interactive data visualization.
-	DAX and Power Query for data modelling and transformation.
-	Dataset (CSV) –  healthcare_dataset.csv
-	Dynamic filters.
## Key insights: 
-	The average billing amount per patient is consistent across all medical conditions, even though the total revenue generated by each medical condition varies.
-	Diabetes and Obesity are the primary revenue drivers, generating the highest total revenue despite Arthritis having more patient volume. This indicates that the average billing per patient for Diabetes and Obesity is slightly higher than for Arthritis. However, since the total revenue difference across all conditions is less than 0.5%, the financial distribution remains extremely balanced. 
-	Uniform Billing Distribution: Average costs are nearly identical across all medical conditions (~$25.5k), indicating a likely synthetic dataset designed with a uniform distribution.
-	Low Cancer Billing Paradox: Despite being a high-resource condition, Cancer has the lowest average billing. In a real-world context, this suggests the billing system may only be capturing "hotel" costs (room rates / basic nursing/ general administration) rather than specialized oncology treatments.
-	 Data Integrity: The presence of negative billing amounts and perfectly balanced patient counts across conditions further indicates that the data does not reflect actual clinical cost variations.
-	Differences in total revenue generated by admission types, test results, medications, medical conditions, and insurance providers are narrow, showing how costs are balanced or they are standardized. This is not always possible in real–world data.
-	For almost every medical condition and insurance provider pair, since the average billing amount per patient is flat, if an insurance provider has high total revenue for a particular medical condition, it is because they have more patients, not because they are being charged more per patient.
-	Emergency admissions do not necessarily correlate with the highest billing.
-	Abnormal and inconclusive results when combined (nearly 66 %) suggest a heavy workload for follow-up consultations.
-	The total patient distribution in admission types, test results, and gender is proportionate.
-	Medical condition is not a predictor of stay duration.
-	Average billing per patient is constant regardless of length of stay. This is the most critical "synthetic" flag. In the real world, longer stays = higher bills. The zero correlation here is the strongest proof of a randomized dataset.
-	The average billing per patient remains consistently around $25,000 across all years and months, indicating stable pricing. Consequently, revenue variations are driven mainly by patient volume and whether a given year contains records for all 12 months, as not all years have complete monthly data.
-	While the dataset overall shows revenue in every calendar month (May 8, 2019 – June 6, 2024), individual hospitals have sparse and uneven records that prevent month–to–month trend analysis. Therefore, to accurately prevent monthly revenue trends, the data should be aggregated at all hospitals / medical condition level rather than at the individual hospital level.
## Screenshots:

-	The "Hospital" column is likely just a list of random names, making any hospital-specific strategy or benchmarking invalid.
